Chatttr.sketchplugin
====================

A little experiment with GET requests and programatically drawing Paths in [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). This plugin fetches the 5 most recent chat / drawing entries from a [“Chatttr.sketchplugin”](http://chatttr.com/chatttr.sketchplugin/) room on the public chat service, [Chatttr](http://chatttr.com/). (Because of the anonymous, unmoderated nature of Chatttr some entries may be NSFW. Read [Chatttr’s About Section](http://chatttr.com/about.html).) Sketch plugins are written in CocoaScript which is basically JavaScript with access to Cocoa frameworks and a splash of that sassy Objective C bracket syntax.
